# **LeetSpeak**

## Description
LeetSpeak is a Python program for translating English messages into leetspeak. It employs a character mapping dictionary to convert specific letters and numbers into symbols commonly used in leetspeak. The program includes a 70% chance of converting a character to leetspeak, which adds a random element to the output. For easy sharing, the resulting leetspeak message can be printed to the console and/or copied to the clipboard.

## How to Contribute
This code is complete and does not require additional contributions at this time. But, like with any program, there may be opportunity for development or extra functionality in the future. Users are urged to report any faults or suggestions for improvements.

## Additional Points
1.	To copy text to the clipboard, this application makes use of the pyperclip package. If you do not have this library installed, the script will skip the copy phase without displaying an error message.
2.	The application has a 70% likelihood of translating a character to leetspeak built in. The 0.70 value in the English to leet speak function can be changed to adapt this value.
3.	Only a limited amount of character mappings are supported by the application. When needed, further mappings can be added to the char mapping dictionary.

## Conclusion
â€¢	LeetSpeak is a fun and easy Python application that converts English texts into leetspeak. It is simple to install and run on any computer that has Python3 installed. Contributions are encouraged and much appreciated!
